I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University, where I was advised by Dan Halperin.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a roboticist specializing in multi-robot systems and their applications to smart mobility. My research focuses on the design of effective control and decision-making mechanisms to allow multi-robot systems to tackle complex problems for the benefit of the society. I draw upon ideas that span across the disciplines of engineering, computer science, and transportation science, to develop scalable optimization approaches with substantial guarantees regarding quality and robustness of the solution. For my work I received multiple awards, including the Clore Scholars and Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowships, best paper awards and nominations ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and teaching awards.\nIn addition to my academic interests, I take pleasure in being outdoors (mountain biking and hiking), traveling around the world, and enjoy food, cooking, music, books, and meditation.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://kirilsol.github.io/author/kiril-solovey/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/kiril-solovey/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, working with Marco Pavone.

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, working with [Marco Pavone](http://asl.stanford.edu/people/). I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University, where I was advised by [Dan Halperin](http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/danhalperin). 

I'm a roboticist specializing in multi-robot systems and their applications to smart mobility. My research focuses on the design of effective control and decision-making mechanisms to allow multi-robot systems to tackle complex problems for the benefit of the society. I draw upon ideas that span across the disciplines of engineering, computer science, and transportation science, to develop scalable optimization approaches with substantial guarantees regarding quality and robustness of the solution. For my work I received multiple awards, including the [Clore Scholars](https://clorefoundation.org.il/clore-scholars-programme/) and [Fulbright Postdoctoral](https://www.fulbright.org.il/) Fellowships, best paper awards and nominations ([1](https://www.roboticsfoundation.org/awards/best-student-paper/),[2](https://www.roboticsfoundation.org/awards/best-paper/), [3](https://mrs2017.org/awards/),[4](https://ecc20.eu/best-student-paper-award/),[5](http://icra2020.org/program/conference-awards)), and teaching awards.

<!--- My research interests lie at the interface of computer science, robotics, and transportation sciences. I pursue deeper insights into the structural properties of fundamental problems in robotics and transportation, for the design of practical algorithmic approaches. My most recent research focuses on multi-robot systems and their application in smart mobility, with an emphasis on societal aspects. -->

 In addition to my academic interests, I take pleasure in being outdoors (mountain biking and hiking), traveling around the world, and enjoy food, cooking, music, books, and meditation.
